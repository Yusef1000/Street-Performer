When you see something exciting happening in your city, snap a picture and post your thoughts on the share page. This will add your post at your location on the map (feature currently in progress) and to the buzz page, which shows all the latest happenings. You can also search for events by type on the explore page.


VybeCity was built at Hack@Brown2016 by Yusef Abdulla, Pezanne Khambatta, Jacob Ruth, and Emma Sloan. It's pending further debugging, features, and potential publishing.'
